## Features

* Find words on a line by default ( Literal and Regex are available too )
* Find Text in Files faster, by retaining index in memory AND using the quickest form of Serialization for recalling old sessions.  Blits Search is very fast! 
* Real time results update while you type.  
* Search Large volumes of files quickly. 
* Syntax Highlighting + Stong results highlights.
* .GitIgnore / .BlitzIgnore file filter reduces workload and Clutter in results.
* Auto-Human text file filtering Takes burden off Filtering.  ( Think \*.\*, but without worry about binary .exe's slowing down the search )
* FileName filter is a word on line filters taking the same query "\path_name\ @.cs|@.xaml". Only use it when results need filtering.
* Quality of Life focused, Community Driven features ( see Discord invite )

# Fast and Readable

Much care has been put in how the results update, for example real time updates can be a nuisance if presented too fast.  Here we add something like 100-200 MS too keep it from flickering.
